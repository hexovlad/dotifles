# A list of configuration files
## What is this
It's a startup script I put on most of the devices I own after having a fresh install. The script is a work in progress and more functionalities will be added as time goes. 
##  Installing
As simple as ```./installer.sh```, it will ask for sudo access since it installs some dependencies.

## What does it install
This script installs my personal Vim configuration and a PS1.
